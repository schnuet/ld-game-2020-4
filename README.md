## Code conventions

For this project, we will be following the Godot naming conventions. ([See GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html#doc-gdscript-styleguide))

    GDScript: Classes (nodes) use PascalCase, variables and functions use snake_case, and constants use ALL_CAPS.
